# Working-with-RedCap

I couldnt find a Python  project example anywhere that reads an excel file, creates a list of dictionary objects(same format as json) and loads that list into redcap. Most examples used hard coded JSOn objects as examples which werent that helpful. 
Im also creating a mapped version of the excel file. I used the PyCap module to do the importing into RedCap. Also used dataframes just to grab the mapping file. 
Thee are examples of correcting date formats, formatting numbers etc before the data is uploaded.
